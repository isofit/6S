Unofficial 6S for easy isofit integration and argument updates

This is an unofficial repository for the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector (6S) code.  The official location of the code is here: https://salsa.umd.edu/6spage.html.  Please see the official site for documentation, additional aerosol models, and the official version.  Code was uploaded here as of 6SV2.1 (2014), in 2025.  Additional updates that may be implemented in this repository are not necessary sanctioned by the core development team.  That rationalization for this asynchronous upload is to support additional capabilities (mainly inputs and outputs) from 6S that support additional sRTMnet emulator capabilities, which many ISOFIT workflows utilize.

The ISOFIT team expresses sincere gratitude towards the 6S team for all of their efforts.
